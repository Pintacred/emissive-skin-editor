Emissive Skin Editor is an online editor where you can edit which parts of your skin will glow. This creates a resource pack which you can apply Bedrock Edition. This resource pack only works in Bedrock Edition.

To use, you just have to import your skin, select what type it is (wide or slim), and you can start drawing the emissive pixels on it. You can also import an emissive map (which is only black and white, not grayscale) to convert it or edit it so you don't have to redraw the entire thing every time you want to modify just a small portion of your skin's emissive pixels.

You can adjust the brightness of the camera or the room to see how it would look like in the dark.

The editor only works with 64x skins at the moment.
